Problem Statement: Inconvenience in Bus Travel
in India
Overview:
Booking buses in India is a common mode of transportation. However, users
often face inconvenience when they have to board the bus, as they are unable to
track the bus location in real-time. This becomes especially problematic when
there are delays, leading to users waiting unnecessarily or missing the bus.

Core Problem:
The core problem is the lack of a reliable and real-time tracking system for
buses in India. Users need a solution that allows them to track the location of
the booked bus and receive timely updates about any delays or changes in the
schedule.

Impact:
This inconvenience can result in users wasting time waiting at the bus stop or,
in the worst case, missing their buses. This not only affects the user experience
but also leads to frustration and dissatisfaction among travelers.

Our Approach:
As the ”Trouble Shooters” group, our goal is to develop a solution that addresses
this problem. We aim to create a real-time bus tracking system that provides
users with accurate information about the location and status of their booked
buses. This will enable users to plan their departures more efficiently and reduce
the stress associated with uncertainties in bus travel.

Benefits:
Implementing a reliable bus tracking system will enhance the overall user experience, improve customer satisfaction, and contribute to a more efficient and
organized public transportation system in India.
